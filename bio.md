Eisner has contributed to _W_, _Vogue Paris_, _Pop_, _The New York Times Magazine_, _T Magazine_, _Vanity Fair_, _Travel + Leisure_, _Departures_, _Harpers Bazaar_ and _Liberation_. Solo shows of her of her photographs have been exhibited at Jan Kesner (_Rodeo Girl_, 2000) and M+B Gallery (_A Butterfly Fluttered By_, 2006 and _Psychonaut_, 2010).
