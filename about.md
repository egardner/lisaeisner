title: About Lisa Eisner Jewelry
---
<h2>This collection is inspired by the two sides of Big Sur. One side is the turbulence of the water, the kelp beds encrusted with invert&shy;ebrates, protozoa, decapods, urchins, barnacles, sea anemones... These pieces are sculptural. The other side is the serene quiet California coast. These pieces are pure and modernist and more quiet.</h2>
 
<h2>Everything is made in bronze with a special patina that looks like a beautiful worn gold. I work with a family owned turquoise mine in Arizona, and each stone is hand picked for each piece. I'm crazy about black jade, Big Sur jade, chrysocolla and fossilized walrus teeth or cave bear teeth from Alaska.</h2>

<h2>Each piece is a little sculpture and has the wonderful magic of the earth...</h2>

**Lisa Eisner** was raised in  Cheyenne, Wyoming, moved to New York City in 1979, and currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband. (Her two grown sons have flown the coop.)  Lisa was a fashion editor at _Mademoiselle_ and at _Vogue_, where she was the European Editor in Paris and later West Coast Editor in Los Angeles.  

After more than 15 years in the fashion business, she decided to focus on her own photography and interest in subcultures and ceremonies. She has published two books of her work, _Rodeo Girl_ (1999) and _Shriners_ (2004). In 1999, she co-founded **Greybull Press** in order to publish art and photography books by artists including R Crumb, Richard Prince, and Dennis Hopper.  

Eisner has contributed to _W_, _Vogue Paris_, _Pop_, _The New York Times Magazine_, _T Magazine_, _Vanity Fair_, _Travel + Leisure_, _Departures_, _Harpers Bazaar_ and _Liberation_. Solo shows of her of her photographs have been exhibited at Jan Kesner (_Rodeo Girl_, 2000) and M+B Gallery (_A Butterfly Fluttered By_, 2006 and _Psychonaut_, 2010). In 2014, she launched her own hand crafted line of jewelry.
